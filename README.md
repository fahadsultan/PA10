<center><h1>PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 10
<br/><br/>Topological Sort</h1>
<br/>

**Due: Wednesday, December 4th, 2024, 2:30 PM**</center>

<br/>

In this assignment, you are to implement the provided Graph interface using edge list representation and implement the two topological sorting algorithms, namely, the Depth First Search (DFS) and the Kahn's algorithm covered in class.

## Q1. Depth First Search (DFS) Topological Sort

Implement the [Depth First Search (DFS)](https://fahadsultan.com/csc223/datastructs/graphs_topo_dfs.html) algorithm to find the topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

## Q2. Kahn's Algorithm

Implement the [Kahn's algorithm](https://fahadsultan.com/csc223/datastructs/graphs_topo_kahn.html) to find the topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

--- 

Feel free to define any additional <u>private</u> helper methods or classes as needed. 

You are to write JUnit test cases in corresponding test classes for each of the four classes above. Make sure to test all the methods keeping in mind any <u>edge cases</u> that may arise.

## **Instructions**
1. Click on `Accept Assignment` at the link posted on Moodle. This is equivalent to forking the repository.</font>
2. Navigate to the repository you just forked. It should be named `pa10-<your-github-username>`
3. Click on the green `Code` button. Click on SSH tab and copy the SSH link (it is important to use SSH and not HTTPS).
4. Open the terminal on your computer and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository.
5. Run `git clone <copied-ssh-link>`. Replace `<copied-ssh-link>` with the link you copied in step 3.
6. In Visual Studio Code, click on File -> Open and open the folder of the repository. 

## Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated based on the correctness **_and completeness_** of your implementation and test cases. If your implementation is correct but your test cases are incomplete, you will lose points. If your implementation is incorrect, you will lose even more points.

## **Code Review**
This assignment will only be graded after you schedule and complete an in-person code review 
with the instructor within 5 working days after the due date, if not earlier. \
Use [this calendly link](https://calendly.com/ssultan-dpq/) provided on the course website to schedule a code review.
